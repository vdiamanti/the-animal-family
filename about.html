<p> Carolyn is Irish and is studying to be a Dietitian. She's a chef, a baker - specialising in vegan cakes, and is happily married to her partner with two Chihuahua-children. </p>    
<p> We met on a Code First Girls course, and got to talking about all the animals in our lives, inspiring us to create a website dedicated to them. <!--- more blurb about ourselves might be cute but of course, not strictly necessary --> </p>
