<p> Carolyn is Irish and is studying to be a Dietitian. <br> She's a chef, a baker - specialising in vegan cakes, <br> and is happily married with two Chihuahua-children. </p>    
<p> Carolyn and Violeta met on a Code First Girls course, and as they talked about the animals in their lives they were inspired to create this website to show them off. </p>
